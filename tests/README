Tests for xmppfs:

To add Your own test please create script in format NN_NAME.sh. Where NN is a two digit number. NAME is given by your choice. Your tests should be given high numbers soo normal tests will perform normaly. I assume you may want to test your own modification. If you decide to send patch to me I will require in the future the results of my own tests and later your own. I need to be sure that core functionality is stable.

To run tests run startTests.sh

You script can run anything - including programs.


Environment:

startTests.sh sets this variables (this may grow in time):
XMPPFS_PATH=`pwd`/../xmppfs
TEST_LOG=`pwd`/tests-`data +%F-%T`.log
